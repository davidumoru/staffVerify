## User Authentication

The user authentication functionality allows users to log in and retrieve their information. The login process requires providing an email and password. If the credentials match a user in the system, a successful login response is returned. Otherwise, appropriate error messages are returned.

## Company Registration

The company registration feature allows new companies to sign up by providing their details such as name, address, contact information, and logo. Upon successful registration, a confirmation message is returned.
